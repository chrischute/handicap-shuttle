## TODO
  1. Login screen cleanup.
    - Larger text fields.
    - Don't obscure text fields with keyboard.
  2. Get user's current location for on-demand ride requests.
    - *Optional*: Use Google Maps API.
  3. Create app icon.
  4. Map of buildings to street side coordinates.
    - *Optional*: Table view that slides up with address suggestions.
  5. Dispatcher approval of rides.
    - *Prototype 1*: Generate email with ride info. Send back email with addresses filled in.
    - *Prototype 2*: Central database with all rides.
      - Sends push notification to rider when ride gets approved.
      - Sends push notification to driver when needs to leave.

## Ideas
  1. Mark all Yale buildings on map as waypoints.
    - *E.g.*, "Stiles to SSS" should work to populate route on map.
